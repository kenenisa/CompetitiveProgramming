Input
The first line contains two integers, n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ n) — the number of vertices of the tree and the maximum number of consecutive vertices with cats that is still ok for Kefa.

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each ai either equals to 0 (then vertex i has no cat), or equals to 1 (then vertex i has a cat).

Next n - 1 lines contains the edges of the tree in the format "xi yi" (without the quotes) (1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n, xi ≠ yi), where xi and yi are the vertices of the tree, connected by an edge.

It is guaranteed that the given set of edges specifies a tree.

Output
A single integer — the number of distinct leaves of a tree the path to which from Kefa's home contains at most m consecutive vertices with cats.

Solution 

Let the number of restaurants be R then we have R leafs in the park, we can traverse through the paths of 
the tree. if we don't find any m consecutive cats then the leaf node should return 1. if we find m consecutive cats
then we should return 0 for that path. Then all the sum of what the paths return will be the answer.

The other tricky part is to construct a tree from the x and y we are given. x maybe the child or the parent or 
y could be the child or the parent, so we need to consider each case. and when we start traversing through the 
paths of the tree we should ignore the parents and just consider the children.
